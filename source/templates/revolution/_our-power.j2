 [The web] is the <b>largest human powered information network in history</b>. It has a culture,
 a history, and a social structure. <b>It's organic</b> and only problems of a region's development or a government's
 interference limit it...<b>It's uncontrolled</b>, even <b>out of control</b>,
 and that's <b>its real power</b>.
